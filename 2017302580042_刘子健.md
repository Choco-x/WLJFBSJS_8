## P15
TCP header has 20 bytes and IP header has 20 bytes, so each datagram actually loads 1460 bytes.
(5*10^6)/(1460)=3425（向上取整）

## P17
a) Collect all IP packets sent from the NAT in a period of time,
check how many packets are in the set, and ensure that the sequence number of packets in the set is continuous. 
The number of these collections is the number of hosts.

b) Not working properly.
