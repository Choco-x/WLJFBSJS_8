# Homework 8

### Question 1

> **P6.** Consider a datagram network using 8-bit host addresses. Suppose a router uses longest prefix matching and has the following forwarding table:

| Prefix Match | Interface |
| -- | -- |
| 00 | 0 |
| 010 | 1 |
| 011 | 2 |
| 10 | 2 |
| 11 | 3 |

> For each of the four interfaces, give the associated range of destination host addresses and the number of addresses in the range.

>> **My Answer:**

| Interface | Range | Number of Addresses |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 0 | 00000000 - 00111111 | 2<sup>8</sup> / 4 = 64 |
| 1 | 01000000 - 01011111 | 2<sup>8</sup> / 8 = 32 |
| 2 | 01100000 - 10111111 | 2<sup>8</sup> / 8 + 2<sup>8</sup> / 4 = 96 |
| 3 | 11000000 - 11111111 | 2<sup>8</sup> / 4 = 64 |

### Question 2

> **P19.** Consider the SDN OpenFlow network shown in Figure 1. Suppose that the desired forwarding behavior for datagrams arriving at s2 is as follows:

![Figure1.jpg](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/04/26/JcvD4U.jpg)

<center>Figure 1</center>

- any datagrams arriving on input port 1 from hosts h5 or h6 that are destined to hosts h1 or h2 should be forwarded over output port 2;

- any datagrams arriving on input port 2 from hosts h1 or h2 that are destined to hosts h5 or h6 should be forwarded over output port 1;

- any arriving datagrams on input ports 1 or 2 and destined to hosts h3 or h4 should be delivered to the host specified;

- hosts h3 and h4 should be able to send datagrams to **each other**.

> Specify the flow table entries in s2 that implement this forwarding behavior.

>> **My Answer:** 

<center>s2 Flow Table</center>

| Match | Action |
| -- | -- |
| Ingress Port = 1 ; IP Src = 10.3.*.* ; IP Dst = 10.1.*.* | Forward(2) |
| Ingress Port = 2 ; IP Src = 10.1.*.* ; IP Dst = 10.3.*.* | Forward(1) |
| Ingress Port = 1 ; IP Dst = 10.2.0.3 | Forward(3) |
| Ingress Port = 2 ; IP Dst = 10.2.0.3 | Forward(3) |
| Ingress Port = 1 ; IP Dst = 10.2.0.4 | Forward(4) |
| Ingress Port = 2 ; IP Dst = 10.2.0.4 | Forward(4) |
| Ingress Port = 3 ; IP Dst = 10.2.0.4 | Forward(4) |
| Ingress Port = 4 ; IP Dst = 10.2.0.3 | Forward(3) |

### Question 3

> **P20.** Consider again the SDN OpenFlow network shown in Figure 1. Suppose that the desired forwarding behavior for datagrams arriving from hosts h3 or h4 at s2 is as follows:

- any datagrams arriving from host h3 and destined for h1, h2, h5 or h6 should be forwarded in a clockwise direction in the network;

- any datagrams arriving from host h4 and destined for h1, h2, h5 or h6 should be forwarded in a counter-clockwise direction in the network.

> Specify the flow table entries in s2 that implement this forwarding behavior.

| Match | Action |
| -- | -- |
| Ingress Port = 3 ; IP Dst = 10.1.*.* | Forward(2) |
| Ingress Port = 3 ; IP Dst = 10.3.*.* | Forward(2) |
| Ingress Port = 4 ; IP Dst = 10.1.*.* | Forward(1) |
| Ingress Port = 4 ; IP Dst = 10.3.*.* | Forward(1) |
